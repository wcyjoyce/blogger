# Typeprint

Typeprint is my own attempt at creating a blogging platform, written in pure Ruby without any frameworks or testing libraries. This project is inspired by my desire to start my own blog.

Please feel free to check it out: http://typeprint.herokuapp.com.


### Built With

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) - the web framework used
* [Chartkick](https://www.chartkick.com) - used to generate JavaScript charts
