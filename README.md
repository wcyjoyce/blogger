# Typeprint

Typeprint is my own attempt at creating a blogging platform, written in pure Ruby without any frameworks or testing libraries. This project is inspired by my own desire to start my own blog â€“ which I've literally done so now, but not so much in terms of content.

Feel free to check it out at http://typeprint.herokuapp.com.


## Built With

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) - the web framework used
* [Chartkick](https://www.chartkick.com) - used to generate JavaScript charts
